CHANGELOG

03-18-23
-Uploaded to Github
-Added new moderators category for commands
-Added a filler addgm command to hold the place
-Modified commands.py and created new files for mod commands, also created changelog

-Updated the default server in servers.json to include a "teamlist" object
-Made addgm command functional
-Added new -teamlist command under mods category
#NOTE: mods category won't necessarily be commands only accessible by mods. I intend on keeping a separate system, since some commands (runfa, editing settings, etc) will have to be mod-only but fall under other categories anyway. Mods command is just relating to general maintainance and broad, universal commands.

03-19-23
-Happy Laetare Sunday
-Added functional -removegm command

-New alias 'setgm' which can act in place of 'addgm' (aliases are stored in main.py)
-Updated default server in server.json to include maxRoster and holdout settings, simple FA related settings to test the system on
-Added new '-settings fa' screen to display the existing FA settings
-Added to settings_checks.py, checks for said settings, and updated settingsDirectory in commands.py (is commands.py a bad place for that? It wouldn't be hard to move)

03-25-23
-Added FA commands category
-Fixed an error in the command aliases
-Added base offer command

-Added two new arrays to the default server, offers and backupOffers

03-30-23
-Offer command

-Made the draft team on -bio default to "undrafted" if no team is found

I give up, no more changelog. Big things are happening
